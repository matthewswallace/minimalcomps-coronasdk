# Minimalcomps for Corona SDK

This is an attempt to port the Minimalcomps UI lib by Keith Peters to use with Corona SDK.
Anyone that would like to contribute is welcome I would just ask that you follow the suggested OOP for Lua in this article by Jesse Warden http://bit.ly/yWMKmd in order to use some sort of basic inheritance.

The goal would be to match features as close to the original lib but I would like to add the ability to skin the components a bit as well. Maybe some way of pointing a component to a directory of assets to use for it's skin?

## About the fonts

You will need to install the font that is in the root directory in order to use it in the simulators. The build.settings file is set up to show you how to include it in an actual build to an ios device. 


## About the project

This is an alpha project of course at this point and I will be building most components as I need them. Feel free to do the same. The CoronaSDK has a lack of components for building basic UI and it would be great to have a complete set thats customizable.
