# Minimalcomps for Corona SDK

This is an attempt to port the Minimalcomps UI lib by Keith Peters to use with Corona SDK.
Anyone that would like to contribute is welcome I would just ask that you follow the suggested OOP for Lua in this article by Darren Osadchuk http://bit.ly/uTJi4k in order to use some sort of basic inheritance.

The goal would be to match features as close to the original lib but I would like to add the ability to skin the components a bit as well. Maybe some way of pointing a component to a directory of assets to use for it's skin?

This is an alpha project of course at this point and I will be building most components as I need them. Feel free to do the same. The CoronaSDK has a lack of components for building basic UI and it would be great to have a complete set thats customizable.
